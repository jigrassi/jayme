# jayme

Jayme is a mental math game where players face off 1v1, drafting matrices.

At the end of the draft, each player's matrices are multiplied together and its trace is determined.

A matrix's trace is the sum of its main diagonal, from top left to bottom right.

The player with the higher trace wins.
